Hello Guys!

If you're reading this, that means you found my Ableton Rack useful! Thank you so much!
This rack is free to use, customize and distribute. Share it with your friends, make cool sounds with it. 
I'll be super happy if this is used in some actual sound design project!

The Rack is in the Ableton Project file and should be available once you open the project itself. Just replace my kick with your sample and enjoy! 
I hope it works as intended, if not, email me on parthrane1141@gmail.com and we'll make sure you get the rack!

Warm Regards,
Parth
